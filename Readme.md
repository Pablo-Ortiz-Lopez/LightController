# LightController

The LightController is a versatile device designed to provide remote control for up to three dimmer units. This README provides a brief overview of the project's status and its available resources.

## Project Status

**Work In Progress (WIP)**

The LightController project is currently a work in progress. As such, I am actively developing and refining its features, firmware, and hardware components. While the project is in its early stages, I recommend patience until a stable working prototype is achieved.

## Features

The LightController aims to offer the following features once it reaches a stable state:

- **Remote Dimmer Control**: Control up to three dimmer units remotely, allowing you to adjust the lighting in your space effortlessly.

## Resources

To support the development and utilization of the LightController, I provide the following resources:

- **Firmware**: The firmware for the LightController is available as a PlatformIO project. This firmware will enable the remote control of dimmer units once it is fully developed.

- **Electronics**: The electronic design of the LightController can be found in the KiCad project files. These files enable you to understand and customize the hardware aspects of the device to fit your specific needs.

## Getting Involved

I welcome contributors who are interested in helping me refine and complete the LightController project. If you have ideas, suggestions, or code improvements, please feel free to contribute. Together, we can make this project a valuable addition to the world of remote lighting control.
